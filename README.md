# cash_manager
This Python script enables personalized finance management and tracking. It operates in a manual mode where users must update values themselves. The menu offers essential functionalities such as adding or subtracting funds (requiring a reason for deductions). All activities are logged in 'charges.txt' within the script's directory, with an option for comprehensive viewing. The balance automatically updates in 'cash.txt'. Users also have the capability to reset all files to their original state. All activities are securely recorded, eliminating concerns about data loss.
